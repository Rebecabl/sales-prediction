| **Description**                                                                         |
| This project features a Linear Regression model developed in Python using the Scikit-Learn library, and incorporates tools like MLflow and Flask for model monitoring and deployment. |
| **Example Data Generation**                                                              |
| - An example dataset is generated containing information on advertising investments and their respective sales. The data is organized into a Pandas DataFrame. |
| **Training the Linear Regression Model**                                                 |
| - Using the Scikit-Learn library, a Linear Regression model is trained based on the training data. |
| **Model Evaluation**                                                                     |
| - The model is evaluated using the test set, and the Mean Squared Error is calculated to measure the model's accuracy. |
| **Integration with MLflow**                                                              |
| - MLflow is a platform for managing the complete machine learning lifecycle. Here, a run is initiated in MLflow to track parameters, metrics, and model artifacts. |
| **Logging and Metric Storage**                                                           |
| - Metrics, such as the Mean Squared Error, are logged in MLflow for continuous evaluation of the model's performance. |
| **Model Persistence**                                                                    |
| - The trained model is persisted using MLflow, allowing for easy reproducibility and deployment. |
| **Integration with Flask**                                                               |
| - The Flask application is incorporated into the project to create a simple API for predictions with the trained model. |
| **Execution and Results**                                                                |
| - The project can be executed to train the model, evaluate its performance, and deploy an API for making predictions with the optimized model. |
| **Purpose**                                                                             |
| This project serves as a hands-on introduction to implementing machine learning models, including best practices for monitoring and deployment using tools like MLflow and Flask. |
